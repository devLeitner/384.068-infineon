# Zigbee Integration

## Content

This directory contains the code for integration the application into our local HomeAssistant service.

## Functionality

The detected state from the ai-model will be sent to an ESP32-C8 using UART. The ESP32 then uses Zigbee to bring the data into our HomeAssistant.
